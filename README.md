# SSH Bruteforce

## Objective
The goal of the SSH bruteforce project was to simulate how weak passwords containing relations to an employee's organization can be leveraged by adversaries. This project consisted of utilizing a controlled environment along with tools and scripts in Kali linux to extract information from a website (Delta airlines in this example) and using the info to create a wordlist for an SSH bruteforce attack. The purpose was to enhance my understanding of attack techniques, tools, and iterate the importance of strong passwords.
